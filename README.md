# pulsar-core

This is the core package for the pulsar project API. It contains most of the abstractions
utilized by other packages as well as some base models shared by multiple packages. All
the request wrappers and boilerplate are defined here, as well as some more framework-y
modules which packages plug into. This includes the user model.
